Android Project

This Simple Android Project was an idea proposed in Chapter 17 of the HTML and CSS course I took with Gustavo Guanabara. It aimed to encourage students to reflect on what they had studied and how to apply these teachings.

The project aims to explain the history of the Android mascot and how various software updates have succeeded.

It has multiple features in CSS, including responsiveness for all types of devices and an array of different media that changes depending on the screen size.

Login Project

This Login Project was one of the proposed challenges during the classes of the HTML and CSS course I took. Developed in a similar way to what was presented in the videos, with small differences in the design and the image originally used in the course.

In this challenge, the competences queried were:

- Forms, which are used to capture data for the functioning of systems and applications;

- Media Queries and Media Features, which are essential for dynamicity and portability across all electronic devices;

- Positioning and ordering of boxes, which mold the layout of the site.

There are 4 states in which the site can look: Smartphones and small screens, Tablets or Netbooks, Desktop, and Big Screens.

Cordel Project

This Cordel Project was the main challenge of the 3rd module the HTML and CSS course I took. The site aims to present a "cordel" written by Milton Duarte, that is based in the technology and all the possibilities it brings to us.

It has different media queries and is supported on all devices.

Social Project

This Social Media Project aims to explore the array of possibilities the iframe tag offers to your HTML document.
