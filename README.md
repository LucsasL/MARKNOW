# Marknow Project | Fictional Marketing Company

MARKNOW is a web project showcasing a digital marketing company that has great numbers and partners. Fully build with React JS and it's technologies. It has several features, such as Hooks, States and Routers. I used GSAP to make movement animations in some sections of the site.

The design of the website is based on the neubrutalism style, all of it's elements has simple background, pastel colors and solid shadows.

It's still incomplete yet, but I'll work to fix the bug as soon as possible. Since this project use many technologies, I couldn't work properly since I didn't develop enough repertory to work as I need to.

***Work In Progress***
